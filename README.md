# Data-Analyst-Certificates
I have successfully completed the Certificate Program in Data Analytics from IIT Jammu, gaining strong academic and practical exposure to data preprocessing, statistical analysis, SQL, and dashboard development.

Additionally, I completed a 6-month Data Analyst Internship where I worked on real-world datasets, performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and created interactive dashboards to support business decision-making.
